# Help wanted

This is a first pass at a website for the group.  This has all the basic 
info.  It isn't pretty, but it will do the job.  If anyone wants to 
improve it in any way whatsoever, please do.

## How to contribute

The main things you need to know to contribute:

1. The stylesheets are written in Sass via [Compass][compass] and live 
   in the `sass` directory.  If you `bundle install` you'll get a 
   compass executable.  So in the project root you can `compass watch` 
   to automatically recompile stylesheets as you edit them.  If you just 
   want to compile the stylesheets, it's `compass compile`.
2. We're using the [Goldilocks Approach to responsive 
   design][goldilocks].
3. Blame any poor organization and/or weird code/markup on Charlie. :)
